                <h1>An Examination of Emma W's Tea Website</h1>

            <p>I think the style choices you made for your Tea site gave it a very clean look. 
                The menu page reads well and everything is nicely spaced. The photo you used with the DND dice was a great addition, and the
                tea names were fitting. It inspired to me to try making a webpage base of something else.
                So I tried crafting this review in the art style of a particular video game(link at bottom).

                <h3>My Favorite Parts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The font is abvsolutely amazing! Probably the best fantasy style I have seen. Very easy to read, but still really unique looking.</li>
                        <li> The 'M's and the looped 'OO's are cool. I have font envy.</li>
                        <li>Tasteful choice in background color. Suddle whitish/blue maybe?</li>
                        <li>The menu picture goes great with the font color. It also has neat transparent effect.</li>
                        <li>The link at the bottom for crediting the author is well placed, and made me realize I need to think of that in the future</li>

                <h2>Feedback</h2>
                <p>Having trouble coming up with any potential improvements. 
                    Even your html and css is formatted nicely. The only real change I would make,
                    would be rounding the edges on your about picture. Clearly I am biased, but I think it's a quick way to improve presentation.
                    Other than that very very minor thing, I thought everything was great, nice job :)</p>

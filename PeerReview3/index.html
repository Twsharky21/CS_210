                    <p class="person1">Announcer 1: We've seen a lot of great work from this young man earlier in the season, and if you ask me he's just getting started!</p>
                    <p class="person2">Announcer 2: Couldn't agree more! His website game has really come into it's own. It really showcases his attention to clean functionality.</p>
                    <p class="person1">Announcer 1: I don't know about you, but I love the inclusion of the copywright symbol Announcer 2!</p>

                    <p class="person1">Announcer 1: His website has well structured containers that clearly display his activities! Apparently when he's not making websites, he plays golf occasionally!!</p>

                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> We've seen a lot of great work from this young man earlier in the season, and if you ask me he's just getting started!</p>
                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> Couldn't agree more! His website game has really come into it's own. It really showcases his attention to clean functionality.</p>
                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> I don't know about you, but I love the inclusion of the copywright symbol Announcer 2!</p>
                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> I have a name.</p>
                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> Speaking of names! Lets give a shout out to our sponsor! "Fairway Cement Company: Cementing the Future of Golf Courses!"</p>
                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> ... That doesn't seem right</p>

                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> I have to say I like the color choice! It really grabs the eye!</p>
                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> Well, I thought the contact form was very tasteful, saves the user a step or two.</p>
                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> His website has well structured containers that clearly display his activities! Apparently when he's not making websites, he plays golf occasionally!!</p>
                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> Why are you always yelling?</p>

                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> I think it's great start to this tournament for him!</p>
                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> If he continues to push it with some pictures and nice font I think he could take home the win.</p>
                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> Absolutely! Everything he said! Also, add lots of Ninjas!!!</p>
                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> What does that even mean!?</p>

                    <p class="person2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 2:</span> Wow, so many questions. Is he taking Web Development 2 in the fall? Does he have thoughts on merging his different passions?</p>
                    <p class="person1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announcer 1:</span> Would snakes be less scary if they had people teeth? HAHAHA!!</p>

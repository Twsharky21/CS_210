                <p>Hey, this is Sharky(Travis), and I am reviewing: <a href=https:>Searra's Intro Page</a>.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Structure:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I like how the home page is really clean. A home page is usually just links to 
                        other parts of a site anyway.</li>
                    <li>Both links work, including light/dark mode.</li>
                    <li>Order of links made sense, and plenty of spacing to read them.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Style:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I know this may not have been intentional but the way the two 'M's line up is a cool effect.</li>
                    <li>You presented the information about you and your dogs in the slide out. 
                        Kind of nice having the information right there without clicking.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Content:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nice home page background color, looks professional and easy on the eyes.</li>
                    <li>Good High resolution photo. Using the black ground really helped put focus on the image.</li>
                    <li>I like the rounded edges on the dog pictures. I didn't realize how it gives an image extra cuteness.</li>
                </ul>
